# Open Municipality

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0-beta.1.

## Getting Started

To take advantage of the web-app you need to:

1. Get a copy of the code.
1. Install the dependencies if you don't already have them.

### Get the code

Clone this repository on your local machine or download the
[latest release][latest_release].

### Prerequisites (for everyone)

The full webapp requires the following major dependencies:

1. [NodeJS][node_link], used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.

1. [npm][npm_link], the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used
to install Node.js packages.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
